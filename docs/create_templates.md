This guide covers creating your own documentation templates.  If the provided styles don't quite cut it for you, you can
easily create your own.
-----BODY-----
If you haven't read the [Getting Started](getting_started.html) guide yet, you should do so now.

# Coming Soon...

Since Documentr is still in beta, this guide is not written yet.  I don't want to write any docs on this just yet, as
there may still be some API changes.

However, you can take a look at the source and use the current template(s) as a guide to create your own right now.  If you 
installed Documentr via Pear, you'll need to put your templates in the templates folder for Documentr wherever your Pear packages
are installed.
