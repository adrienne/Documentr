# Documentr

Documentr is a documentation generator that is inspired by the Rails Guides (http://guides.rubyonrails.org).
Basically, I've had the need for a long time to create documentation for various projects, and found there weren't
really any good solutions out there.  One day, while perusing the Rails Guides reading about Rails 3, it occurred to me
that not only were they sexy, but they are laid out and organized quite well.

So, I grabbed a markdown parser and the Symfony YAML component, and whipped up Documentr.  I'm currently working on getting
an official site and documentation set up for it, but if you're super-anxious to see what it can do you can grab a copy of
the repo, tweak the documentr file a bit to find the stuff in src, and then run it in the sample directory.  You should 
get the gist of things.  If not, sit tight, I'm gonna have official docs soon.
